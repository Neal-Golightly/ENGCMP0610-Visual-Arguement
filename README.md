# ENGCMP0610-Visual-Arguement

My visual arguement addresses the current American child care crisis. Several Americans not understand the seriousness and perplexity of this issue and many Americans ignore the problem entirely. My visual arguement targets whole families with children particularly parents and grandparents. Many of the problems surrounding the American child care crisis could be fixed with Biden's American Families Plan. The American Families Plan would spend $225 billion to improve child care. The American Families Plan would allow day care centers to hold onto their staff and open more job positions for new staff. My visual arguement's rhetorical goal is to both bring awareness of the American child care crisis and to support the cause of the American Families Plan.
